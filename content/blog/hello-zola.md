This blog has migrated from Quartz to Zola. The previous version was feature-rich with backlinks, graph views, and Obsidian integration. This new version prioritizes simplicity.

## Why the Change?

Quartz is excellent for digital gardens and interconnected notes. However, for a straightforward blog, it carries unnecessary complexity. Zola offers:

- **Fast builds**: Written in Rust, compilation is nearly instant
- **Simple structure**: Plain markdown files with TOML frontmatter
- **No JavaScript dependency**: Static HTML output
- **Nix-friendly**: Single binary, easy to include in flake

## What to Expect

The content focus remains the same:

- Machine learning techniques
- AI systems and infrastructure
- Conference paper summaries
- Occasional homelab notes

The design is intentionally minimal. No fancy features, just words on a page.
