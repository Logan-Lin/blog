My name is Yan Lin, and this is my personal blog where I occasionally post my thoughts and findings during research.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University. My research interests include _spatiotemporal data mining_, _representation learning_, and _AI for science_. I am also personally interested in full-stack development and tinkering with hardware.
